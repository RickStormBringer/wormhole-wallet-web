            cryptography to ensure the security of the data transmission and access,
            uses automated Smart Contract to program and operate data, and it is a new

        <p>

            designated wallet address which no party has access to the wallet’s private
            key, and thus no party will be able to utilize or transfer such token.

            3. <strong>Smart Property.</strong> Smart Property provides a platform for
            Users to launch their creative projects. Users can launch their own
            projects through Smart Property, and distribute the tokens in exchange for
            WHCs from other Users. Users can also review other users’ Smart Property
            projects and acquire tokens created by these projects. The Users will need
            to burn certain amount of WHCs in order to use this function.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <strong>Crowd Sale.</strong> Crowd Sale allows the Users to launch their
            own projects, and other Users can support these projects by sending WHCs to
            these projects. The Users will need to burn certain amount of WHCs in order
            to use this function.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. <strong>Airdrop.</strong> Wormhole Wallet allows its Users to distribute
            free tokens that are supported by Wormhole Wallet to other Users’ accounts.
